Units and convention
====================

Units
-----

This package creates SnowProfile object in which data are expressed in SI units (with a few exception). For example, heights are expressed in meters. The units of each parameters are defined in the documentation.

When reading and writing data, the snowprofile package handles unit conversions.

Convention
----------
This package uses snow height to describe the vertical profile of all snow properties, so that **the "zero" is at the bottom of the snowpack**.
