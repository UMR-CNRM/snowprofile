Uncertainty  and quality representation
=======================================

Let's start with definitions:

Uncertainty
    Uncertainty refers to the quantitative uncertainty defined as the 68% confidence interval on the measured value or standard deviation of various measurments (which is equivalent under the hypothesis of a normal distribution of errors).

Quality
    Quality is a qualitative indication on the uncertainty on measurement compared to the typical uncertainty of the method used. We use a 4 level scale:

    - Good: reliable data within the standard quality of the method
    - Uncertain: data whose quality is probably below the standard quality of the method (doubts in the measurement or data processing procedure).
    - Low quality: data whose quality is undoubtedly below the standard quality of the method due to measurements or data processing procedure.
    - Bad: undoubtedly erroneous data

    As soon as the level is not set to "Good" (which is assumed if no provided), some additional details should be provided in the associated profile comment.
