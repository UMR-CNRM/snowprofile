Look and plot profiles
==========================

Looak at the SnowProfile object
-------------------------------

To have an overview of the content of a ``SnowProfile`` object, you can use the ``rich`` package:

.. code-block:: python

   import snowprofile
   sp = snowprofile.SnowProfile()
   from rich import print as rprint
   rprint(sp)


We plan to provide a dedicated tool in the future.
